# Train-Scheduler
This webpage allows users to add trains to a list, including each train's name, destination, first arrival time, and frequency. A jQuery function then updates the current train schedule with the new train information every time the user clicks the submit button. This information is stored in a Firebase database, and is loaded and displayed in the current train schedule every time a user opens the page. The page also utilizes Moment.js, along with the first train arrival time and frequency information provided by the user, to determine what time the next train will arrive and how many minutes until then from the time that the page loads.
